# EDBank_EudaldDavi
Project from DAM1 
A project with java, scene builder for the graphical interface and an online database (it is possible that this database has already expired as it is free). It goes over to a bank (like an ATM), you log in and from there you deposit or withdraw your money by making changes in the database of the logged-in session.
